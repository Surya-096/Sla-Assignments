        <p>Machine learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on developing models and algorithms that let computers learn from data without being explicitly programmed for every task. In simple words, ML teaches the systems to think and understand like humans by learning from the data.</p>

        <h2>Module 2: Supervised Learning</h2>
        <p>Supervised learning algorithms are generally categorized into two main types:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Classification- <p>Classification teaches a machine to sort things into categories. It learns by looking at examples with labels (like emails marked "spam" or "not spam"). After learning, it can decide which category new items belong to, like identifying if a new email is spam or not. For example a classification model might be trained on dataset of images labeled as either dogs or cats and it can be used to predict the class of new and unseen images as dogs or cats based on their features such as color, texture and shape.</p></li>
            <p><b>Explaining classification in ml, horizontal axis represents the combined values of color and texture features. Vertical axis represents the combined values of shape and size features.</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each colored dot in the plot represents an individual image, with the color indicating whether the model predicts the image to be a dog or a cat.</li>
                <li>The shaded areas in the plot show the decision boundary, which is the line or region that the model uses to decide which category (dog or cat) an image belongs to. The model classifies images on one side of the boundary as dogs and on the other side as cats, based on their features.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>

        <h3>Types of Classification:</h3>
        <p>When we talk about classification in machine learning, we’re talking about the process of sorting data into categories based on specific features or characteristics. There are different types of classification problems depending on how many categories (or classes) we are working with and how they are organized. There are two main classification types in machine learning:</p>
        <h4>1. Binary Classification</h4>
        <p>This is the simplest kind of classification. In binary classification, the goal is to sort the data into two distinct categories. Think of it like a simple choice between two options. Imagine a system that sorts emails into either spam or not spam. It works by looking at different features of the email like certain keywords or sender details, and decides whether it’s spam or not. It only chooses between these two options.</p>
