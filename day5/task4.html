        <p style="color: blue;">Today’s enterprises are inundated with data, and making sense of it can greatly help businesses make better decisions. But the sheer volume coupled with complexity often makes data difficult to analyze using traditional tools. Building, testing, iterating, and deploying analytical models for identifying patterns and insights in data eats up employees’ time in a way that scales poorly. Machine learning can enable an organization to derive insights quickly as data scales.The rate of data generation is accelerating, creating more data than ever before, and machine learning helps make it possible to analyze and find value in this vast amount of data. As such, machine learning is opening an entirely new realm of what humans can do with computers and other machines. Machine learning helps businesses with important functions like fraud detection, identifying security threats, personalization and recommendations, automated customer service through chatbots, transcription and translation, data analysis, and more. Machine learning is also driving the exciting innovation of tomorrow, such as autonomous vehicles, drones, and airplanes, augmented and virtual reality, and robotics. </p><br>
        <p style="color: crimson;">Artificial intelligence is an area of computer science concerned with building computers and machines that can reason, learn, and act in a way resembling human intelligence, or systems that involve data whose scale exceeds what humans can analyze. The field includes many different disciplines including data analytics, statistics, hardware and software engineering, neuroscience, and even philosophy. Whereas artificial intelligence is a broad category of computer science, machine learning is an application of AI that involves training machines to execute a task without being specifically programmed for it. Machine learning is more explicitly used as a means to extract knowledge from data through techniques such as neural networks, supervised and unsupervised learning, decision trees, and linear regression.</p><br>
        <p style="color: chartreuse;">Machine learning works by training algorithms on sets of data to achieve an expected outcome such as identifying a pattern or recognizing an object. Machine learning is the process of optimizing the model so that it can predict the correct response based on the training data samples. Assuming the training data is of high quality, the more training samples the machine learning algorithm receives, the more accurate the model will become. The algorithm fits the model to the data during training, in what is called the “fitting process.” This process involves using a loss function to measure the model's errors, and an optimization technique, like gradient descent, to adjust the model's parameters and minimize those errors. If the outcome does not fit the expected outcome, the algorithm is re-trained again and again until it outputs the accurate response. In essence, the algorithm learns from the data and reaches outcomes based on whether the input and response fit with a line, cluster, or other statistical correlation.</p>
        <p id="p1">Unsupervised learning is a machine learning model that uses unlabeled data (unstructured data) to learn patterns. Unlike supervised learning, the “correctness” of the output isn't known ahead of time. Rather, the algorithm learns from the data without human input (and is thus, unsupervised) and categorizes it into groups based on attributes. For example, if the algorithm is given pictures of apples and bananas, it will work by itself to categorize which picture is an apple and which is a banana. Unsupervised learning is good at descriptive modeling and pattern matching. The most common unsupervised learning algorithms used today include</p><br>
        <p id="p2">Reinforcement learning is a machine learning model that can be described as “learn by doing” through a series of trial and error experiments. An “agent” learns to perform a defined task through a feedback loop until its performance is within a desirable range. The agent receives positive reinforcement when it performs the task well and negative reinforcement when it performs poorly. An example of reinforcement learning is when Google researchers taught a reinforcement learning algorithm to play the game Go. The model, which had no prior knowledge of the rules of Go, simply moved pieces at random and “learned” the best moves to make. The algorithm was trained by positive and negative reinforcement to the point that the machine learning model could beat a human player at the game.four.</p>
