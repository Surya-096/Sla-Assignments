    <ol>

        <li>Marinate chicken: mix chicken with yogurt, ginger-garlic, red chilli, turmeric, biryani masala, salt, half
            the mint & coriander, green chillies and lemon juice — refrigerate 30 min–2 hr.</li>
        <li>Fry onions till deep golden; drain on paper — reserve ¾ for layering and ¼ for garnish.</li>
        <li>Boil water with salt + whole spices; add soaked rice and cook until ~70% done (grains still firm). Drain.
        </li>
        <li>In a heavy-bottom pot, heat oil/ghee, add a few whole spices, sauté 2–3 tbsp fried onions, then add
            marinated chicken and cook on medium until chicken is about 80% done and oil separates (10–15 min).</li>
        <li>Reduce heat. Layering: spread half the par-cooked rice over the chicken, sprinkle half the chopped mint &
            coriander and some fried onions.</li>
        <li>Add remaining rice as top layer; sprinkle remaining mint, coriander, saffron milk, a tablespoon ghee, and
            remaining fried onions.</li>
        <li>Seal pot (tight lid or dough) and dum: cook on high for 5–7 min to build steam, then very low heat for 25–30
            min (or bake sealed at 180°C / 350°F for 20–25 min). Use a tawa/griddle under the pot to avoid burning.</li>
        <li>Turn off heat and let rest sealed for 10 min.</li>
        <li>Open carefully, gently fluff and mix layers once or twice to distribute chicken and rice.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with raita, salad and lemon wedges; garnish extra fried onions and coriander.</li>
    </ol>
